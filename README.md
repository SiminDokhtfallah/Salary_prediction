The upcoming project is my first endeavor in the field of data science. This project is conducted using the information acquired during my initial training course, which took place at 'Teach me RoadMap Academy'. It focuses on predicting the salaries of various jobs in the data science domain across different states in the United States. The dataset used has been collected by  'Teach me RoadMap Academy'. The project involves various stages such as data understanding, data preparation, modeling, and evaluation. The outcome is a trained model capable of predicting salary based on 'Job title', 'Rating', and 'State'.
At the end, I would like to express my gratitude to my dear teacher Mona Hatami.
The second notebook "Salary_Prediction_classification" primary objective to evaluate salary satisfaction within a given dataset, approaching it as a classification task. The Logistic Regression model was chosen for its effectiveness in such scenarios. The accuracy score, calculated using this model, yielded a favorable result of 0.7044, surpassing the performance of alternative models like k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.  More details are available in a notebook which is attached to the file.
